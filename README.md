# cable.js

An effect system and FRP runtime for JavaScript

## Building

All the build dependncies are managed through NPM, so you'll need to install 
that first. One you've cloned the repository. You can install dependencies 
locally using:

    npm install

At this point, you can now build cable.js using:

    grunt build

To run the examples, you should also run `bower install` in the `examples` 
directory to get front-end dependencies used by some of the examples.
